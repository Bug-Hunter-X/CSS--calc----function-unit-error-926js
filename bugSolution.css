The corrected CSS code addresses the unit handling issue by ensuring that both the percentage and pixel values have explicit units:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
}
```

This modification ensures consistent and accurate calculation across different browsers, resulting in the expected width of the element.
